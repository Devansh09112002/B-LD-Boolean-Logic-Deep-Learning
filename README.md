 Here, you'll find Python code implementations of neural network algorithms that use XOR logic and Boolean backpropagation. The focus is on exploring how binary neural networks can be trained without traditional gradient methods, using XOR operations and bit-flipping for optimization. These algorithms (Algorithms 4-8) offer an interesting approach for working in binary spaces. Each script is written to be simple and easy to follow, with plenty of comments and examples to help you understand how things work. Perfect for running on Google Colab, so feel free to dive in and experiment!
